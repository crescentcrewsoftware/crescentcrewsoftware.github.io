Verse 1 Steam rising from the pot, it's dinner time again
 Tomatoes dancing with garlic, like old Italian friends
 Minced beef sizzles in the pan, onions join the show
 A sprinkle of oregano, let the flavours flow

Chorus Spaghetti bolognese, you're my comfort and my craze 
Twirl you on my fork, you're the highlight of my days
Simmer slow, let the magic grow
In a sauce that always stays
Spaghetti bolognese, oh how you amaze

Verse 2 Red wine splash, a secret dash, grandmaâ€™s recipe
Bay leaf floating like a boat in a saucy sea
Pasta boiling, hearts are warming, plates begin to shine
Dinnerâ€™s served, the worldâ€™s alright, one bite at a time

Chorus Spaghetti bolognese, you're my comfort and my craze
 Twirl you on my fork, you're the highlight of my days
 Simmer slow, let the magic grow
 In a sauce that always stays
 Spaghetti bolognese, oh how you amaze

Bridge From Bologna to my kitchen, youâ€™ve travelled far and wide
 But every time I taste you, itâ€™s like a joyride 
No need for fancy dining, no need for silver trays 
Just a bowl of love and laughter â€” spaghetti bolognese

Final Chorus Spaghetti bolognese, you're my comfort and my craze 
Twirl you on my fork, you're the joy I always raise 
Simmer slow, let the magic grow Spaghetti bolognese â€” forever you amaze
