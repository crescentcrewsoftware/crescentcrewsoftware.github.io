 <p>The bus leader was a tradition created in 2023</p>
 <p>The first bus leader sat in one of four back row seats.</p>
 <p>Usually positioned on the left, the bus leader elects a new leader at the end of each academic year </p>
 <p>The leader elects 3 people to sit in the back with him</p>
 <p>Currently, the 4 people in the back are preppy_FARMS, horse_tree22, bananabanana68 (the leader) and arsenal_rules7 </p>
